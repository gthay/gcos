  "faq_q1_question": "What is Open Source?",
  "faq_q1_answer": "Open Source means that a software's source code is publicly accessible and can be viewed, used, modified, and distributed by anyone. Unlike proprietary software controlled by individual companies, Open Source belongs to the community. This creates transparency, fosters innovation through collaboration, and ensures that technology is not monopolized in the hands of a few. For AI systems, this is particularly important: Open Source AI enables everyone to understand how decisions are made and adapt the technology to their own needs.",
  "faq_q2_question": "What does \"democratically governed\" Open Source AI mean?",
  "faq_q2_answer": "Democratically governed Open Source AI goes beyond freely accessible code. It means that decisions about the development, direction, and use of AI projects are made transparently and with active community participation. Instead of individual companies or institutions setting the direction, all stakeholders – developers, users, and organizations – have a voice. At GC.OS, we promote governance structures that enable this democratic participation. This ensures that AI technology is developed in the interest of society and remains sustainable, fair, and trustworthy in the long term.",
  "faq_q3_question": "How does GC.OS support Open Source developers?",
  "faq_q3_answer": "We create the framework conditions so developers can focus on what they do best: developing great software. GC.OS provides the legal and organizational framework for Open Source AI projects – from license consulting to governance structures to administrative support. Through our fellowships, developers receive financial support and can work full-time on their projects. Additionally, we offer career development, networking with the community, and access to resources. This allows developers to put their energy into innovation while we handle the organizational framework.",
  "faq_q4_question": "How does GC.OS support companies and organizations?",
  "faq_q4_answer": "We accompany companies and organizations in successfully implementing Open Source AI systems. Our consulting services include analyzing your specific requirements, identifying suitable Open Source solutions, and developing customized implementation strategies. We help you choose the right tools, overcome technical hurdles, and empower your teams. You benefit from our deep expertise in the Open Source community and our network of leading AI projects.

  "faq_q5_question": "How does GC.OS support individual users and learners?",
